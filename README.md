### Restaurant Directory | About Us
This project aims to specialize in providing consumers a complete and accurate electronic listing of Restaurants located throughout Lagos State and possibly. By utilizing a Smart Search Technology, consumers searching for Restaurants and Dining locations, now have the ability to search for restaurants by City or State and by other various search methods including proximity.

When users finally find a restaurant that interests them, they can easily get more information of that restaurant like directions on how to get to the location, or read reviews from that restaurant and also have an idea of the average meal cost.

Searches can be fine tuned by the use of Filters and Search to Restaurants all within a specific location, displaying only those search results.

Restaurant owners are provided free business listings.

### FUTURE PLANS
When finally Onboarding, Restaurant owners have the option of enhancing their listing by adding special services available only to Registered Restaurant Owners.
